description: I submitted the <a href=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16378-skateboarder-emoji.pdf>initial Emoji proposal for a "Skateboarder" emoji</a> for the Unicode Consortium. This "well formed proposal" was accepted without revisions by the Unicode Emoji Subcomittee and a skateboard emoji is included in Unicode 11.1, with a release in 2018.
